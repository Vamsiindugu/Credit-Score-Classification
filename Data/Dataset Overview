Dataset Overview
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset (dataset-2.csv) to classify customer credit scores.

Key characteristics of the dataset include:

Dimensions: It comprises 100,000 rows and 28 columns.
Data Types: The columns consist of int64, float64, and object (representing categorical or text data). The object type columns require encoding for use in machine learning models.
Target Variable: The Credit_Score column, an object type, serves as the target variable with categories 'Good', 'Standard', and 'Poor', indicating a classification problem.
Missing Values: Several columns, such as Num_of_delayed_payment, Num_Credit_Inquiries, Credit_Mix, and Amount_invested_monthly, contain significant missing values. Type_of_Loan notably has a high count of null entries.
Unique Identifier: Customer_ID is a unique identifier and is excluded before modeling.
Data Quality: No duplicate rows were identified, though some columns might contain placeholder or extraneous values.
