    "## **Project Summary -**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to address a critical business need for Paisa Bazaar: enhancing their credit risk assessment capabilities. As a leading financial services company, accurately evaluating a customer's creditworthiness is fundamental to minimizing loan defaults and providing personalized financial products. The current process relies on credit scores, which are a primary indicator of a borrower's likelihood to repay debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict an individual's credit score category ('Poor', 'Standard', or 'Good'). To achieve this, we will use a comprehensive dataset (`dataset-2.csv`) containing various customer attributes, including demographic information, income details, loan history, credit card usage, and payment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows a structured data science workflow:\n",
    "1.  **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** We begin by loading the dataset, performing an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, identify data types, and check for missing values or inconsistencies. A significant data wrangling phase follows, where we clean and transform messy columns (like 'Credit_History_Age', 'Type_of_Loan') to make them usable for analysis.\n",
    "2.  **In-depth Visualization (EDA):** Following the UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate) rule, we create over 15 visualizations to uncover patterns, relationships, and key drivers of credit scores. Each chart is accompanied by an analysis of its insights and the potential business impact for Paisa Bazaar.\n",
    "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:** We formalize key observations from the EDA into statistical hypotheses and use appropriate tests (like ANOVA and Chi-Square) to validate our assumptions.\n",
    "4.  **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing:** This stage involves handling missing values through strategic imputation, encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.\n",
    "5.  **Machine Learning Modeling:** We implement and evaluate three powerful classification algorithms: Logistic Regression (as a baseline), Random Forest, and XGBoost. We assess their performance using a suite of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a special focus on their business implications.\n",
    "6.  **Model Optimization and Selection:** We fine-tune the models using `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation to ensure robustness. The best-performing model is selected based on a comprehensive evaluation.\n",
    "7.  **Conclusion and Business Value:** The final model provides Paisa Bazaar with a powerful, data-driven tool to automate and improve the accuracy of credit score classification. This can lead to better risk management, reduced default rates, faster loan approvals, and the ability to offer more targeted financial advice to customers, ultimately driving business growth and customer satisfaction."

    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "The primary challenge for Paisa Bazaar is to accurately and efficiently assess the credit risk of its customers to facilitate loan approvals and offer suitable financial products. An inaccurate assessment can lead to significant financial losses from loan defaults or lost business opportunities from incorrectly rejecting creditworthy applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to solve this problem by building a machine learning classification model to predict a customer's credit score category ('Poor', 'Standard', or 'Good') based on their financial and personal data. The model must be reliable, interpretable, and provide actionable insights to help Paisa Bazaar make informed, data-driven decisions, thereby enhancing their risk management framework and improving overall business outcomes."

    "**Answer Here:**\n",
    "Based on the initial data exploration, I've gathered the following key information about the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Dimensions:** The dataset contains **100,000 rows** and **28 columns**, providing a substantial amount of data for analysis and model building.\n",
    "2.  **Data Types:** The columns consist of a mix of `int64` (numerical integers), `float64` (numerical floats), and `object` (categorical/text) data types. The `object` columns will require encoding for machine learning.\n",
    "3.  **Target Variable:** The `Credit_Score` column is our target variable. It is of type `object` and appears to be categorical ('Good', 'Standard', 'Poor'), making this a classification problem.\n",
    "4.  **Missing Values:** There are significant missing values in several columns, including `Num_of_delayed_payment`, `Num_Credit_Inquiries`, `Credit_Mix`, and `Amount_invested_monthly`. The `Type_of_Loan` column has a particularly high number of nulls. These will need to be handled carefully through imputation or removal.\n",
    "5.  **Unique Identifier:** The `Customer_ID` column appears to be a unique identifier for each customer and will likely be dropped before modeling.\n",
    "6.  **Data Quality:** There are no duplicate rows, which indicates good data integrity at the record level. However, I suspect some columns might contain placeholder or garbage values (like `_` or `#F!`) that aren't registered as NaNs, which will require further investigation during data wrangling."

    "I performed several crucial data wrangling steps to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Dropped Irrelevant Columns:** I removed `Customer_ID`, `Name`, `SSN`, `Month`, and the empty `ID` column as they are identifiers or context columns with no predictive value. `Type_of_Loan` was also dropped due to its high volume of missing values and extremely messy, inconsistent entries, making it unreliable. I also dropped `Monthly_Inhand_Salary` to avoid multicollinearity with `Annual_Income`.\n",
    "2.  **Cleaned and Converted Numerical Columns:** Several columns that should be numeric (like `Annual_Income`, `Age`, and `Num_of_Loan`) were stored as `object` types because they contained non-numeric characters (e.g., '_', '$'). I systematically removed these characters and converted the columns to a numeric format, coercing any remaining errors into `NaN` for later imputation.\n",
    "3.  **Engineered `Credit_History_Age_Months`:** The `Credit_History_Age` column was in a text format (\"X Years and Y Months\"). This is not usable by machine learning models. I created a function to parse this string and convert it into a single numerical feature representing the total credit history in months. This makes the feature quantitative and directly usable.\n",
    "4.  **Standardized Categorical Placeholders:** Categorical columns like `Credit_Mix`, `Payment_Behaviour`, and `Occupation` contained various placeholder values (e.g., '_______', '#F!'). I replaced all these inconsistent placeholders with standard `NaN` values. This centralizes missing data handling and ensures consistency. I also mapped 'NM' in `Payment_of_Min_Amount` to 'No' based on the logical assumption that it means 'Not Made'.\n",

Having very few or no loans can also lead to a 'Standard' or 'Poor' score, likely due to a thin credit file.\n",

Removing these data points could lead to a loss of valuable information about high-net-worth or high-risk individuals.

    "\n",
    "Through a comprehensive process of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering, we transformed a raw, messy dataset into a clean, analysis-ready format. The visualization phase revealed several key drivers of creditworthiness, including **payment punctuality (`Delay_from_due_date`), the nature of a customer's credit mix, the level of outstanding debt, and the length of their credit history**. These insights were statistically validated through hypothesis testing, confirming their significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated three different machine learning models and found that a **tuned XGBoost Classifier provided the best performance**, achieving a weighted F1-score of over 85%. This model proved particularly effective at identifying customers in the high-risk 'Poor' category, which is critical for minimizing potential loan defaults. The feature importance analysis confirmed that the model's predictions are driven by financially sound and interpretable factors, building trust in its decisions.\n",

    "The final, saved model is a valuable asset for Paisa Bazaar. It can be integrated into their operational workflow to:\n",

    "*   **Enable the offering of personalized financial products and advice based on a customer's predicted credit health.**\n",
    "*   **Provide a consistent and data-driven basis for credit-related decisions.**\n",
